This is my attempt to make our collaboration easier — think of it as my **default settings**.  
It’s not a rulebook; it’s a conversation starter.  
If something doesn’t work for you, tell me. Let’s co-design how we work best.

## 🧭 What Drives Me

I optimize for three things — roughly in this order:

1. **Team health** → sustainable pace, psychological safety, and continuous growth  
3. **Impact** → Both user outcomes (better experiences) and business outcomes (reliability, efficiency, growth enablers)
4. **Engineering excellence** → quality that compounds over time  

When these trade off (and they will), I’ll make the tension explicit.  
**My failure mode:** under pressure, I sometimes flip this order. Please call it out if I start sacrificing health for speed.

## 💬 How I Communicate

### Slack
- Async-first, but I don’t expect everyone to be  
- Tag me directly if you need input — I won’t see everything  
- “👀” means *I’ve seen it; I’ll reply later*  
- **I sometimes work odd hours** — due to family commitments or time-sensitive business needs — but **late-night messages ≠ expectation to respond**. Please disconnect outside your hours unless it’s a production incident.
- I’ll share regular team updates with stakeholders — the more context you share, the fewer interruptions from me  

### 1:1s
- Weekly, 30–45 minutes (but if anything urgent please don't wait let's talk asap)
- Your agenda > mine  
- Focused on: how you’re feeling, what you’re learning, what’s blocking you  
- Less on: status updates (I can read those)  

### Meetings
- If I call one - expect context and goals shared upfront  
- If I seem distracted, tell me — it means I failed to protect focus time  

### Feedback
- I use [**SBIE**](https://engagedly.com/blog/importance-of-sbi-when-giving-feedback-in-workplace/) → Situation → Behavior → Impact → Expectation  
- Direct but kind, usually in 1:1s unless time-sensitive  
- **What I am working on:** I sometimes soften feedback too much — please ask me to be clearer if needed

## 🧠 How I Make Decisions

**The key question:** [_Can we reverse this?_](https://shit.management/one-way-and-two-way-door-decisions/)

- **Two-way doors (reversible):** move fast, test, learn, iterate  
- **One-way doors (hard to reverse):** slow down, gather input, think harder  

Examples:  
- Two-way → UI tweaks, feature flags, internal tooling  
- One-way → database schemas, public APIs, compliance or architectural foundations  

> “Move fast” never means skipping quality — it means streamlining safety nets.  
> If process slows us down unnecessarily, we fix the process.

**Decision ownership**
- Default: the person closest to the problem decides - most often **you** 
- I step in to *stress-test*, not to take over  
- I’ll override only for safety, compliance, or misalignment with company strategy  
- I ask “why” a lot — it’s curiosity, not criticism

## 🤝 What I Need From You

**Non-negotiables**
- Communicate blockers early — Monday beats Friday  
- Own outcomes, not just tickets  - “feature shipped“ matters less than “conversion improved“
- Be kind — we can disagree strongly and still respect each other  

**Preferences (not mandates)**
- Write things down → helps me process  
- Ask questions publicly → helps others learn  
- Share work-in-progress → I love seeing process, but it’s optional  

If my defaults don’t work for you, tell me what does.

---

## 🎁 What You Can Expect From Me

- **Clarity:** If goals feel fuzzy, I've failed. Push me on this
- **Advocacy:** I'll fight for your growth, compensation, and recognition 
- **Transparency:** You’ll know the context — even when it’s uncomfortable  
- **No surprises:** If something's off, you'll hear it before performance review time
- **Air cover:** I’ll handle organizational noise so you can focus  

What I *can’t* do: make every decision fast, shield you from all ambiguity, or guarantee every project will be meaningful. I'll try, but I'm working within constraints too.

## 🧭 How I Define Team Success

We’re succeeding when:
- We ship reliable, high-quality work that improves customer outcomes  
- Engineers grow and feel psychologically safe  
- Stakeholders trust our delivery and communication  
- We’re proud of *how* we build, not just *what* we ship

## 🪞 How to Give Me Feedback

I genuinely want it — here’s what helps:

- **Specific > vague** → “Yesterday in stand-up…” beats “You don’t listen”  
- **Timely > batched** → don’t wait for 1:1s  
- **Private > public** → but I can handle public if needed  
- **Impact-framed** → “When you do X, I feel Y” helps me adjust  

Recent feedback:  
> “You say ‘let me think about it’ a lot — it feels like indecision.”  
They were right — I now explain *why* I need time before deciding.

## ❤️ When I’m Not at My Best

**Stress signals**
- I go quiet in meetings (I'm overthinking)
- I ask the same question twice (I'm not processing well) 
- I jump to solutions before understanding (I'm anxious about delivery)

**What helps**
- Ask directly: “You seem tense — what’s going on?”  
- Clarify: “Do you want me to listen or problem-solve?”  
- Push back kindly: “That’s not the right priority right now.”

I'm a human, not a management bot. I'll get it wrong sometimes.

## 🌱 What I’m Working On

- Delegating messier problems (I tend to take too much on myself)
- Saying no earlier (I over-commit when I'm excited)
- Slowing down to speed up (balancing urgency with sustainability)

Please call me out if you see me drifting.

## 🧪 Let’s Iterate Together

This README is **v1.1** — a living document.  
What’s missing? What sounds good on paper but not in reality?  
Let’s build a shared working model, not just follow mine.

---

## 🏠 Outside of Work

- **Family:** Two kids 4&6yo — at times may need to hard stop before 5pm to pick them up from school
- **Background:** Polish by origin, living in Spain since 2023. Still learning cultural nuances — correct me if I misread something  
- **Weekends:** Usually riding my road or gravel bike. Always up for a chat, no pressure to pretend interest  

Sharing this helps explain my rhythms and reminds us we’re humans first.

> Let’s build a team that balances **craft and care** — something we’re proud of, not just for *what* we deliver, but *how* we do it.
