This is my attempt to make our collaboration easier - think of it as my **default settings**.  
It’s not a rulebook; it’s a conversation starter.  
If something doesn’t work for you, tell me. Let’s co-design how we work best.

## 👨‍🦰 Who am I?

In the 16 personalities test I am identified as - [INFP - Mediator](https://www.16personalities.com/infps-at-work) (*Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Prospecting*).

I've spent 20+ years in tech, working across telco, banking, and logistics. I've seen different scales - startups (Uruz Labs), scale-ups (Glovo), and large companies (Goldman Sachs) - which taught me that context matters more than playbooks.  
My technical roots are in backend engineering (mostly JVM languages). 

For the past 6+ years, I've been in leadership roles, focused on building teams that deliver meaningful results while helping engineers grow in their careers.

## 🧭 What Drives Me

I optimize for three things - roughly in this order:

1. **Team health** - sustainable pace, psychological safety, and continuous growth  
2. **Impact** - both user outcomes and business outcomes (the metrics we actually track)
3. **Engineering excellence** - quality that compounds over time  

When these trade off (and they will), I’ll make the tension explicit.  

**My failure mode:** under pressure, I sometimes flip this order. Please call it out if I start sacrificing health for speed.

## 💬 How I Communicate

### Slack
- I prefer async communication, but work however suits you best
- Tag me directly if you need input - I won’t see everything  
- "👀" means I've seen it and will reply later
- I sometimes send messages outside business hours (family schedule or urgent issues), but there's zero expectation to respond until your next working day-unless it's a production incident
- I share regular updates with leadership and stakeholders - the more you keep me in the loop proactively, the less I need to chase you for context

### 1:1s
- Weekly, 30–45 minutes (but if anything urgent please don't wait let's talk asap)
- Your agenda > mine
- We will have a shared document for notes and action items 
- **Focused on:** how you’re feeling, what you’re learning, what’s blocking you  
- **Less on:** status updates (I can read those)  

### Meetings
- If I call one, expect context and goals shared upfront  
- If I seem distracted, call it out - it usually means I'm context-switching too much and need to fix my calendar

### Feedback
- I use [**SBIE**](https://engagedly.com/blog/importance-of-sbi-when-giving-feedback-in-workplace/) framework - Situation → Behavior → Impact → Expectation  
- Direct but kind, usually in 1:1s unless time-sensitive
  
**What I'm working on:** I sometimes soften feedback too much — please ask me to be clearer if needed

## 🧠 How I Make Decisions

**The key question:** [_Can we reverse this?_](https://shit.management/one-way-and-two-way-door-decisions/)

- **Two-way doors** (reversible): move fast, test, learn, iterate  
- **One-way doors** (hard to reverse): slow down, gather input, think harder  

Examples:  
- Two-way - UI tweaks, feature flags, internal tooling  
- One-way - database schemas, public APIs, compliance or architectural foundations  

> "Move fast" never means skipping quality - it means streamlining safety nets.  
> If process slows us down unnecessarily, we fix the process.

**Decision ownership**
- Default: The person closest to the problem. You have the context, you own the outcome, you decide.
- I step in to stress-test, not to take over  
- I’ll override only for safety, compliance, or misalignment with company strategy  
- I ask _"why"_ a lot - it’s curiosity, not criticism  

---

## 🤝 What I Need From You

**Non-negotiables**
- Own outcomes, not just tickets  - "conversion improved" matters more than "feature shipped"
- Communicate blockers early - Monday beats Friday  
- Be kind - we can disagree strongly and still respect each other  

**Preferences (not mandates)**
- Write things down - helps me process  
- Ask questions publicly - helps others learn  
- Share work-in-progress - I love seeing process, but it’s optional  

If my defaults don’t work for you, tell me what does.

---

## 🎁 What You Can Expect From Me

- **Clarity:** If goals feel fuzzy, I've failed. Push me on this
- **Advocacy:** I'll fight for your growth, compensation, and recognition 
- **Transparency:** I'll share context about priorities, constraints, and trade-offs - even the difficult parts  
- **No surprises:** If something's off, you'll hear it before performance review time
- **Air cover:** I’ll handle organizational noise so you can focus  

What I *can’t* guarantee: perfect clarity on every project, complete shielding from organizational change, or that every task will feel deeply meaningful. I'm working within constraints too.

---

## 🪞 How to Give Me Feedback

I genuinely want it - here’s what helps:

- **Specific > vague** - "Yesterday in stand-up…" beats "You don’t listen"  
- **Timely > batched** - don’t wait for 1:1s  
- **Private > public** - but I can handle public if needed  
- **Impact-framed** - "When you do X, I feel Y" helps me adjust  

Recent feedback:  
> "You say ‘let me think about it’ a lot - it feels like indecision."  
They were right - I now explain *why* I need time before deciding.

---

## ❤️ When I’m Not at My Best

**Stress signals**
- I go quiet in meetings (I'm overthinking)
- I ask the same question twice (I'm not processing well) 
- I jump to solutions before understanding (I'm anxious about delivery)

**What helps**
- Ask directly: "You seem tense - what’s going on?"  
- Clarify: "Do you want me to listen or problem-solve?"  
- Push back kindly: "That’s not the right priority right now."

I'm a human, not a management bot. I'll get it wrong sometimes.

---

## 🌱 What I’m Working On

- Trusting you with the hard stuff (I tend to hoard complex problems instead of delegating them)
- Saying no earlier (I over-commit when I'm excited)
- Slowing down to speed up (balancing urgency with sustainability)

If you see me backsliding, I'll appreciate the nudge.

## 🏠 Outside of Work

- **Family:** 2 kids (4 & 6 years old)-at times may need to hard stop before 5pm for school pickup
- **Background:** Polish by origin, Barcelona-based since 2023. I sometimes miss UK cultural references or communicate less clearly in English-tell me directly if something doesn't land right
- **Weekends:** Usually riding my road bike or hitting gravel trails. Always up for a chat about cycling, no pressure to pretend interest  

Sharing this helps explain my rhythms and reminds us we’re humans first.

### Let’s build a team that balances <ins>craft</ins> and <ins>care</ins> - something we’re proud of, not just for *what* we deliver, but *how* we do it.
